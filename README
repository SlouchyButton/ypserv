1024 Byte limit in NIS protocol:
---------------------------------
The NIS protocol has one important limit: keys and data are limited
to 1024 bytes. Today most implementations (especially glibc and this
ypserv implementation) can handle longer keys and data. But this must
not be the case for every implementation, so be careful if you use
entries which are longer.
